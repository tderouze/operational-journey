As the demand for Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) transparency grows, organizations face the challenge of balancing regulatory compliance with meaningful action. ESG reporting is no longer a mere checkbox exercise; it has evolved into a strategic opportunity to drive sustainability, operational efficiency, and innovation. But how do companies embark on this journey? At AVEVA, we believe the path to ESG maturity unfolds in three transformative stages.

### **Stage 1: ESG Reporting**

**Where It All Begins** Organizations typically start their ESG journey by focusing on periodic energy and emissions reporting. These reports, generated monthly or quarterly, aim to satisfy regulatory requirements and meet basic stakeholder expectations.

**The Challenges:**
- Manual and fragmented data collection processes.
- Limited granularity, offering only a high-level overview.
- Retrospective insights that don’t support proactive decision-making.

**How the PI System Helps:** The AVEVA PI System simplifies and automates data collection, centralizing energy and emissions information from multiple sources. This creates a single source of truth for ESG metrics, ensuring reports are accurate, consistent, and audit-ready. By eliminating inefficiencies in data management, organizations can shift their focus toward deeper insights.

### **Stage 2: Industrial Data Foundation**

**Building Real-Time Visibility** Once the basics of reporting are in place, organizations often recognize the need for real-time visibility into their energy and emissions data. This stage marks the transition from static reporting to dynamic monitoring.

**What This Looks Like:**
- **Real-Time Dashboards:** Provide live insights into energy consumption and emissions across facilities.
- **Automated Alerts:** Notify teams when sustainability targets are at risk.
- **Benchmarking:** Compare performance across production lines or sites to identify best practices.

**The Impact:** With a real-time view of energy and emissions, organizations can align their daily operations with their ESG goals. This proactive approach drives faster decision-making, reduces costs, and minimizes environmental impact.

**How the PI System Helps:** The AVEVA PI System enables organizations to integrate operational and industrial data streams, creating a foundation for real-time energy and emissions monitoring. This capability empowers teams to make data-driven decisions that align with sustainability objectives.

### **Stage 3: Advanced ESG Enablement**

#### **3a. Emission Prediction**

**Moving Toward Predictive Sustainability** The third stage of ESG maturity involves leveraging real-time data and predictive analytics. By combining industrial data with external factors such as weather forecasts and energy prices, organizations can predict the energy and emissions costs of production processes.

**Use Cases:**
- Adjusting production schedules to capitalize on lower energy prices or renewable energy availability.
- Simulating the impact of process adjustments on emissions before implementing changes.
- Proactively addressing deviations from sustainability targets.

**The Outcome:** Organizations shift from reactive management to predictive sustainability, optimizing production for cost, emissions, and efficiency.

#### **3b. Ecosystem and Community Collaboration**

**Expanding Impact Across the Value Chain** The final step in the ESG journey extends beyond the organization’s walls. By correlating the price and footprint of materials and production processes with third-party providers and customers, organizations can foster an interconnected energy and emissions cascade.

**Benefits:**
- **Supply Chain Transparency:** Track and optimize the sustainability metrics of suppliers.
- **Collaborative Innovation:** Work with partners to reduce collective carbon footprints.
- **Customer Trust:** Provide end-users with verifiable emissions data.

**Example:** Imagine a manufacturer partnering with suppliers to select materials with lower carbon footprints while offering customers products with traceable sustainability data. This ecosystem-wide collaboration creates shared value and enhances brand reputation.

**How the PI System Helps:** The AVEVA PI System provides the tools to integrate and analyze data across the value chain, enabling transparency and collaboration. By connecting stakeholders through shared data insights, organizations can drive collective action toward ESG goals.
