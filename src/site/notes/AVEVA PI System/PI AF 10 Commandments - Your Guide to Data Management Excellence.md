## The Ten Commandments

### 1. Thou Shalt Use Templates

Templates are your secret weapon for consistency. They streamline asset creation, ensuring each asset inherits the same structure and behaviors. This not only saves time but maintains data integrity across your entire system[1].

### 2. An Element Hierarchy Shalt Follow Standards

Consistency is key when building your hierarchy. Adhere to naming conventions and logical structures. This ensures everyone can find what they need easily, minimizing confusion and simplifying asset management[1].

### 3. Different Views Make Life Easier

[[AVEVA PI System/Unlocking the Power of the Asset Framework\|PI Asset Framework]] offers various ways to view your data. Understanding how to use element views, attribute views, and asset-based views effectively allows you to see your data from multiple angles, improving decision-making and analysis[1].

### 4. Categories Shalt Be Used Everywhere

Categories are your classification superpower. They help organize your assets, making them searchable and easier to manage. Consistent application of categories enhances your asset organization, simplifying maintenance and ensuring nothing slips through the cracks[1].

### 5. Get to Know PI Builder – It Is Your Friend

PI Builder is a powerful ally for managing your assets efficiently. It simplifies bulk operations, like creating or updating elements, templates, and attributes. Mastering PI Builder will save you time and energy[1].

### 6. Defaults Are Not Your Friend

While default settings are tempting, they may not suit your specific needs. Tailor your settings to match your requirements. This ensures your assets behave exactly as you intend, rather than relying on generic defaults[1].

### 7. String Builder and [[AVEVA PI System/Unlocking the Power of Event Frames in AVEVA PI System\|Event Frames]] Are More Friends

String Builder and [[AVEVA PI System/Unlocking the Power of Event Frames in AVEVA PI System\|Event Frames]] are your allies for advanced data manipulation and contextualization. Learn to use them to extract valuable insights from your data, enhancing your asset's capabilities[1].

### 8. Thou Shalt Use Units of Measure

Consistent units of measure are vital for accurate data analysis. Ensure you define and apply units of measure appropriately to your attributes. This guarantees that your data remains reliable and interpretable[1].

### 9. Do Not Only Consider Bottom-Up Approach

While starting from the bottom and building up is common, don't overlook the top-down approach. Start with your higher-level objectives and design your hierarchy accordingly. This strategic approach ensures alignment with your organizational goals[1].

### 10. Thou Shalt Build Smart Elements

Smart Elements are assets that adapt and evolve based on changing conditions. Embrace dynamic behaviors, calculations, and analyses within your elements. Building smart elements enhances your system's agility and responsiveness[1].
