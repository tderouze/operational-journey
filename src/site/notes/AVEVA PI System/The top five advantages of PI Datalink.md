Let's jump together into the top five advantages of PI Datalink.

1. **Data Retrieval.** Gone are the days of manually copying and pasting data or importing them from text files into Excel. With PI Datalink, your spreadsheets update in real time, giving you access to the latest data effortlessly.
2. **Automatic Report Updates**. Need more data? No problem. Simply modify your query and watch your spreadsheet update itself automatically. You can use this feature to create dynamic reports that refresh with the latest information every day.
3. **Data Contextualization**. Thanks to the PI system, one report can serve all your similar assets. Just choose the equipment you want from a drop-down list, and PI Datalink does the rest. Say goodbye to all other reports; one is now enough to cover every single asset.
4. **Built-in Formulas**. Excel has powerful native functions, but they're not tailored for time series data. PI Datalink fills that gap, making complex calculations a breeze. For example, let's take sensor readings from the last 24 hours. If I want to build a report with the hourly maximum and the exact time when the minimum was reached, PI Datalink has a function for that and can quickly provide me with the information. To achieve this result with Excel's native formulas, I would need to segment my raw data by hour, calculate the maximum for each hour, and then cross-reference these results with the raw data to find the time of the maximum. As you can imagine, this involves many steps that PI Datalink can do in one go.
5. **Express Querying**. Last but not least, you can apply conditions to your PI system queries, making your reports incredibly powerful. For example, here, by defining "CDT 158" greater than 100 as the search expression, it is possible to return the time period during which this expression is valid in the unit of your choice. This makes reports extremely powerful and reduces Excel's computational load significantly.

And here's the icing on the cake: PI Datalink reduces the need for raw data in your spreadsheets. This means smaller, more efficient reports that run faster. Plus, it seamlessly integrates with Excel's familiar formatting features.

So there you have it, the incredible advantages of PI Datalink, your Excel superpower for harnessing the full potential of your PI system data. Stay tuned for more insights, and don't forget to subscribe for the latest updates.
