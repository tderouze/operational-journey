Traditional relational database management systems (RDBMS) have long been the go-to solution for data storage and management. However, when it comes to handling time-series data, these systems often fall short. Here's why:

## Data Structure Mismatch

Relational databases are designed with a rigid, table-based structure that organizes data into rows and columns[1]. This structure works well for many types of data but is not optimized for time-series data, which is inherently sequential and timestamp-oriented[4]. Time-series data requires a more flexible approach that can efficiently handle chronological entries without the overhead of complex table relationships.

## Performance Limitations

As data volumes grow, relational databases struggle to maintain performance, especially with time-series data[1]. Queries involving large datasets, particularly those with complex JOIN operations or extensive aggregations, can experience significant delays[1]. This performance degradation becomes more pronounced as the amount of time-stamped data increases, making it challenging to perform real-time analysis or handle high-frequency data ingestion[5].

## Scalability Challenges

Traditional RDBMS face difficulties in horizontal scaling due to their emphasis on maintaining data integrity and consistency across tables[1]. As time-series data often grows rapidly and continuously, the inability to easily distribute the workload across multiple servers becomes a significant limitation[4]. Vertical scaling (increasing the resources of a single server) can only go so far before hitting physical and economic limits[1].

## Inefficient Storage Utilization

Time-series data often requires significantly more storage space compared to the original data sources. It's estimated that for every origin source stored in a relational database, about 10 times more storage space is needed for its associated time-series data[5]. Relational databases are not designed to handle this type of exponential growth efficiently, leading to increased storage costs and management complexity.

## Lack of Specialized Features

Unlike purpose-built time-series databases, traditional RDBMS lack built-in features specifically designed for time-based data analysis[8]. They don't offer native support for time indexing, rolling averages, or seasonality detection algorithms, which are crucial for efficient time-series data processing[8]. This absence of specialized functionality means that complex and potentially inefficient workarounds are often necessary to achieve the desired analysis.

## Maintenance Overhead

Relational databases typically require ongoing manual maintenance when dealing with time-series data[8]. This includes tasks such as data retention management, index optimization, and performance tuning. The increased complexity often necessitates dedicated personnel, adding to the overall cost and effort of managing time-series data in a traditional RDBMS[8].

In conclusion, while traditional relational databases excel in managing structured data with complex relationships, they are not optimized for the unique challenges presented by time-series data. As industries increasingly rely on time-stamped information for critical insights, purpose-built time-series databases or hybrid solutions that can efficiently handle both relational and time-series data are becoming essential for organizations looking to harness the full potential of their data.
