- **Fleet Management and Operational Excellence**: The PI System facilitates the central management of fleet operations by providing a unified view of vessel-specific performance and status. This leads to improved decision-making, traceability in operations, safety, and overall efficiency.
- **Real-Time Data Collection and Analysis**: By implementing the AVEVA PI System, you enable real-time data collection and analysis, which is particularly useful when monitoring hydroelectric power plants or other facilities from a remote location.
- **Energy Efficiency and Fuel Optimization**: The PI System helps monitor energy usage and identify areas for improvement, which leads to reduced costs and environmental impact.... For example, CSL Group achieved fuel savings of approximately 3-5% per vessel per year by deploying the AVEVA PI System.
- **Condition-Based Maintenance**: The PI System serves as a foundation for condition-based maintenance, which helps improve uptime, extend equipment life, and reduce unplanned downtime....
- **Predictive Maintenance**: The AVEVA PI System, combined with predictive analytics, enables early detection of events and shortened algorithm development, which supports predictive maintenance strategies.... Integrating the PI System with a predictive analytics system can lead to cost savings and increased operational efficiency.
- **Compliance and Regulatory Reporting**: The PI System assists with meeting sustainability targets and complying with environmental regulations. It also automates the generation of compliance reports with high-quality information.
- **Digital Twin Implementation**: The AVEVA PI System is useful for creating digital twins of devices and systems, integrating various information sources into a single platform.
- **Remote Monitoring and Support**: The PI System enables remote monitoring of assets and provides real-time visibility into events, which reduces fleet downtime as well as repair and service costs.
- **Training and Simulation**: The PI System, when integrated with a training platform such as ShipView, helps crews learn how to perform maintenance and repairs more quickly and accurately.
- **Hull Fouling Detection**: The PI System can be used with advanced analytics to detect and confirm hull fouling, allowing for timely interventions to maintain vessel efficiency.
- **Anomaly Detection**: Anomaly detection systems connected to the PI System allow for supervision and notification, contributing to failure avoidance.

These use cases demonstrate how the AVEVA PI System can be a powerful tool for optimizing ship operations, enhancing safety, and driving sustainability in the maritime industry.
